I) Introducing a New Dataset

II) Handcraft Annotation

III) Fine-Grained Visual Classification via MAS and Ensembling CNN

Introducing a new dataset - called DeepCar 5.0

Including more than 20K images in 480 different models belonging to the top 50 world automakers.

All images have been taken from the front view and the front three-quarter directions.

All images clearly show the main vehicle sections, including the headlights, upper grill, lower grill, bumper, hood, etc. 

DeepCar 5.0 has focused mainly on the 2017-2022 car models, some of which have been displayed just recently in various auto shows.
